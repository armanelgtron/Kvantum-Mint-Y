Kvantum-Mint-Y
==============

Based on the Mint-Y Linux Mint themes. WIP

Installation
------------
There are several different ways to install themes in Kvantum, 
the easiest method is to just install it from the Kvantum Manager.

You can also copy the themes directly to `~/.config/Kvantum/`
or `/usr/share/Kvantum/`.


### Subthemes (such as Mint-Y-Aqua) ###
If you have downloaded directly from the git repo, this will be necessary
if you wish to use the themes other than the base Mint-Y and Mint-Y-Dark.

`cd` into this directory and run `./build_subthemes.py`.
